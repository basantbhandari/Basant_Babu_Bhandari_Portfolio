# Major and Minor Projects in BE

## Project 1: Music From BALA: A Music Generation System

- **Description:** This model is based on Privileged GAN v3 model architecture and we extract the musical information from the midi file using the music21 library. This library is used to extract a sequence of notes and chords present in the midi file. Then, we build the dictionary of notes to encode the notes into numbers and we find the sequence of numbers that represents the music considering the dictionary map. Then, build the model based on the privileged GAN v3 framework, each component of the model consists of an LSTM layer such that it works.

## Project 2: Neplali HandWritten Letter Generation Using Generative Adversarial Network

- **Description:** The generative adversarial networks seem to work very effectively for training generative deep neural networks. Our proposed generative adversarial model that works on 36 classes, each having 10,000 images, generates Nepali Handwritten Letters that are similar to the real-life data set of size 360,000 images. This research paper shows how a generative adversarial framework is used to tell the computer to generate a Nepali Handwritten Letter. Our objective is to synthesize Nepali Handwritten Letters using a learning framework called generative adversarial networks.
